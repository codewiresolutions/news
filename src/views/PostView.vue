          Former Indian tennis legend Sania Mirza recently shared some precious moments from her quality time with
          family and friends in her latest social media post, offering a glimpse into her recent whereabouts.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          In her latest Instagram post, Mirza shared several charming photos from her recent outings in Dubai, where she
          currently resides. She was accompanied by her sister, Anam Mirza, and friends, including Indian actor
          Parineeti Singh, with whom she is often seen together.

          <div class="w-[300px] h-0 border-none"></div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          Taking to the Meta-owned photo and video-sharing app, the former athlete captioned the post: "Soul(is)ful".
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          In the photos, Mirza, who also won six Grand Slams for India, can be seen hanging out with her
          sister and other family members at a mall.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          She also posted an adorable selfie with her five-year-old son, Izhan Mirza Malik, whom she shares with her
          former husband, Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          In one of the photos, Mirza can also be seen sitting with Singh on a boat in the evening, with the 37-year-old
          former athlete's arm wrapped around the 35-year-old actor.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          She also made time for some self-care and self-love as she can be seen getting dolled up at a salon, in
          another one of the photos.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          Mirza's separation from Malik was confirmed after he announced his marriage to Pakistani actor Sana Javed in
          January, this year.
        </p>

        <p class="text-black my-5 text-[16px] font-domine">
          Mirza initiated a 'khula' — a form of divorce in Islamic law that allows a woman to divorce her husband.
          According to sources, this decision came as she was not happy with the 41-year-old cricketer's regular
          interactions with other females.
